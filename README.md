## Project Description

The "Colors and Moodboards" project is structured to build visual themes based on thoughtful color theory, translating those themes into cohesive design elements for various use cases. The workflow progresses from selecting base colors, creating palettes, and developing schemes, to moodboard design and UI component creation.

## Color Process

### 1. Color Selection

The process begins by choosing primary colors from  websites that resonate with each designâ€™s intended emotion and audience. These selections form the foundation for creating palettes that align with the mood and branding requirements of each design brief.

### 2. Color Codes

With base colors defined, cohesive palettes are developed, balancing primary and secondary tones to ensure visual harmony. Each palette is designed to serve as the core color language for specific moodboards, considering accessibility and aesthetic consistency.

### 3. Color Combinations

Color schemes are then derived from these palettes to establish contrast and emphasis within each moodboard. This process involves finding websites with the various color schemes in order to  have an understanding of color combinations complementary and analogous schemes for dynamic, visually engaging layouts.
